## Home Price Prediction Project in US 🤨 🧐
### Business Understanding 😇
Here I want to try to predict the price of houses in King County in Washington Province😆 in the US. As you know, the price of houses has increased significantly in the last decade all over the world. But there are still many people, especially the younger generation, who are currently still a little literate about the increase in house prices 😱😱. One of the steps or solutions to open the eyes of the younger generation is to see how the development and prediction of house prices in the future. Therefore, one of the solutions that I can make is a prediction model (if possible up to the deployment stage with azure/aws). In this kernel, I will mostly use some techniques from linear regression. Come on 🫡

### Data Understanding 😁
King County is home to the largest and fifth largest cities in Washington State, namely Seattle and Bellevue, which together with the third largest city, Tacoma, form the Seattle metropolitan area. The dataset used is obtained from kaggle or kc_house_data where the features contain
- id: the primary key
- date: timeseries time the data was entered
- price: house price
- bedrooms: number of rooms
- bathrooms: number of bathrooms
- sqft_living: square meters of building/house area
- sqft_lot: land area
- floors: number of floors
- waterfront: there is a water view
- view: the number of times the house has been viewed (categorized into 4: number 4 means that it has been viewed a lot)
- condition: how good the condition of the house is
- grade: the score or level of the house given by the local government.
- sqft_above: The area of the house but not the basement.
- sqft_basement: the area of the basement.
- yr_built: the year the house was built
- yr_renovated: year the house was renovated
- zipcode: postal code
- lat: latitude
- long: longitude
- sqft_living15: The living area of the house.
- sqft_lot15: the land area of the lot in the house

### Data Preparation: Feature Engineering 😢
- Feature Engineering
- Unvariate & Bivariate Analysis
- Check for Correlation
- Data Transformation
- Feature Selection
- Binning
- Scaling
- Outlier Removal


### Modeling 😨 😰
- Linear Regression
- KBest
- Ridge
- OLS
- Elastic Net
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boost

### 5. Evaluation 🧐 🤓 😎
- MSE
- RMSE
- R2
- coefficient of determination
